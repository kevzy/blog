Wï»¿elcome to Maasai Mara.

The reserve is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including the "Big Five" (lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, and buffalo) as well as cheetahs, zebras, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, and many more. One of the most famous events in the reserve is the annual wildebeest migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles move in a cycle between the Maasai Mara and the Serengeti in Tanzania.

Visitors can enjoy game drives, hot air balloon safaris, walking tours, and cultural visits to Maasai villages. The Maasai Mara is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in wildlife and the African safari experience.
