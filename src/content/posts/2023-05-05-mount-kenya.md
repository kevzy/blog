Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, standing at 5,199 meters (17,057 feet) tall. It is an extinct volcano with three main peaks, Batian, Nelion, and Lenana.

The mountain is located in central Kenya, just south of the equator, and is surrounded by Mount Kenya National Park. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including elephants, buffalos, antelopes, and over 130 species of birds.
